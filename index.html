        <title>GS Widget Sample Page</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <div id="leader">
            <p>This is your run-of-the-mill sample page to test if GS Widget is working properly.  Just dump this in the same directory as the js and css files, edit the js accordingly, and pop it open in a browser.  Then, you'll see this text, and hopefully a widget box elsewhere on the page.</p>

            <p>And by "edit the js accordingly", I mean set the atomUrl to the URL of your Atom feed.  You can find that by viewing the source of your feed's main page (on Mastodon-based sites, go directly to your @username page, not the four-panel page from which you do your posting) and looking for the <tt>&lt;link&gt;</tt> tag with <tt>type='application/atom+xml'</tt>.  Use the line in the <tt>href</tt> attribute.</p>

            <p>Note that at present, Mastodon sites may not work.  At least on the server I tested it with, the Mastodon software doesn't look like it allows outside Javascript to read the Atom feeds for some reason.  Well, okay, it's a pretty clear reason (Access-Control-Allow-Origin isn't set), but it's still on their code, it appears.</p>

            <p>This is still very very early code.  Most errors won't be displayed.  Use this at your own risk, I'm not offering any guarantees here.</p>

            <p>If need be, tweak the css to taste, and replace the jQuery script line with your favorite flavor of CDN or local file.</p>

            <style>
                #gs_widget { display:none !important; }
            </style>
