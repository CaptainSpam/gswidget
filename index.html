        <div id="leader">
            <p>This is your run-of-the-mill sample page to test if Mastowidget is working properly.  Just dump this in the same directory as the js and css files (and the mastodon_widget.html file), edit the js accordingly, and pop it open in a browser.  Then, you'll see this text, and hopefully a widget box elsewhere on the page.</p>

            <p>And by "edit the js accordingly", I mean set the atomUrl to the URL of your Atom feed.  You can find that by viewing the source of your feed's main page (on Mastodon-based sites, go directly to your @username page, not the four-panel page from which you do your posting) and looking for the <tt>&lt;link&gt;</tt> tag with <tt>type='application/atom+xml'</tt>.  Use the line in the <tt>href</tt> attribute.</p>

            <p>Note that sites running older versions of Mastodon might not work with this.  This appears to have changed recently, but in the past, the Mastodon software didn't allow Javascript to read the Atom feeds.  If this affects you, try convincing your site's admin to update their Mastodon version.</p>

            <p>This is still very very early code.  Most errors won't be displayed.  Use this at your own risk, I'm not offering any guarantees here.</p>

            <p>If need be, tweak the css to taste, and replace the jQuery script line with your favorite flavor of CDN or local file.</p>

            <p>(also, this text is going to be rewritten soon, pending new API data)</p>

             not see the container sitting around, here's a simple fix: -->
        <noscript>
            <style>
                #masto_widget { display:none !important; }
            </style>
